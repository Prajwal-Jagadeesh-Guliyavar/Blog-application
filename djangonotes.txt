djnago project :

setup the environment, setup the app
create the urls.py in the app
update the settings in the project directory just after creating the app
http requests and rendering in the views
creating the view functions/classes
creating the templates directory that has all the html templates 'app/templates/app/files.html'r
writing the DTL codes in the templates for the modification of the templates
creation of the base template and declaring the block : that allows all other child templates to inherit the template features of the base templates
add some dummy data for the testing for the time being
then add the bootstrap starter page for the ease of usage of the bootstrap classes to the base templates

bootstrap 5.3 didnt work for me so i tried 4.0 instead

create a static cirectory for the css files used in there 'app/static/app/file.css'
load those static files to the base template
remember to use the DTL frequently
design the html part of the home page as wished with the help of the bootstrap classes
add the article structure for the home page to seperate each posts from each other
check for teh hardcoded urls in the templates and correct them with the DTL

creating the superuser:
makemigrations command , if no changes are seen then 
migrate command will migrate all the usefull files
then the command createsuperuser; this will create a query once the name and the password is entered
django handles the hashing of the password.

to create the post and not rely on the dummy data Django has the ORM- Object Relational Mapper
using the sqlite3 for the development, and postgresql for the production
    database structures as -> classes a.k.a models
    including the django.contrib.auth.models lets users have the authorities over their posts and this is a many to one model

runnig the 'makemigrations' will create a model that can execute those commands and when 'migrate' is run the file is written and saved
by running the 'sqlmigrate' the sql codebase table is created that helps to write the query into the database {though you dontknow shit about sql}
Shell operations to look at the readable SQL queries
the data created in the shell is the actual data and we use it as the actual data insteadof teh dummy data

create the user app to handle the frontend of the user login modify and logout page
!alway remember to register the created app in the settings.py of the project folder!

instead of creating one's  own form django has the UserCreationForm use it to create a view with the render request
create the template that is the extension of the base templates add the csrf_token for the security and the form structure
form structure for the sign-in and sign-up
add the url to the url patterns of the register templates
take care of the HTTP request of POST for the form submission 
insert the condition blocks for the POST request and the flash message and save the credential in the form 
create a forms handling python file that has the views and the models of the UserCreationForm {class meta here gives the model namespace.}
to style the form properly and present the error messages easly in the noticable colurs we use another app in the django called CRISPY FORMS, add the CRISPY_FORMS to the list of the installed apps.
!!! make sure to check the path of the crispy forms during the installation {may require manually adding the paths in the settings.}

add the path to the url patterns the urls of the login, logout and create the login and logout htmls
while working with the logout form it may throw a status code of 405 if using the djang versions that are higher than 4 or 5 
{ 
    because, 
    unlike the earlier versions from the django the logout endpoint can't be used by the urls method by the GET
    in the current versions the endpoint can be accessed by the POST method
    it can be fixed by including the view of the logout itself and changing the path in the project/urls.py
    
    }
change the nav bar in the base template accordingly
to add the profile 
        create a profile view in the views file of the users
        add the profile button to the nav bar
        create a html template
        and specify the path in the url patterns of the project directory
        add the decorators to the profile view for the additional functionalities
        to avoid or correct the search path conflict add the path directly to the settings file of the project
add the models onetoone so that when the users delete their account or has been deleted then the profile shall get deleted with their account
